Notes:

  1.Option available to read data from fileSystem i.e. SampleData.json file.

  2.For now View exist in .Net Standard shared library.

  3.Better separation of concern can be made if not POC.

  4.IOS handling is not operational.

  5.At app launch, progress bar or spinner can be used until data is loaded.

  6.Scope of code refactoring/optimization do exist.

  7.Took time because of horribly slow PC due to Visual Studio Community 2017 + Xamarin + Emulator & engagement in fresh arrival to    
    Melbourne so early settlement issues.
